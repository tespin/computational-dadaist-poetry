        "This is a tutorial on how to use code to write poetry √† la [Tristan Tzara](https://www.writing.upenn.edu/~afilreis/88v/tzara.html). We'll use the [Python](https://www.python.org/) programming language and [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb) to write code in the browser. If you're an excellent coder / have familiarity with setting up your own environment, you might try something like [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/).\n",

        "All the code is pre-written, so you don't need to know any Python in order to run the program. You also don't need a Google account to view this tutorial. You **do** need to log into a Google account to execute code. \n",

        "A few notes:\n",
        "- This tutorial is adapted from and heavily inspired by the work of [Allison Parrish](https://www.decontextualize.com/).\n",

        "- Google isn't ideal, but most alternatives require installing additional software, and Colab makes it easy to write and share code without that complexity."

        "- [Tracery](https://tracery.io/): Quick and easy to learn text generation tool that can be used in JavaScript and Python. Created by [Kate Compton](http://www.galaxykate.com/).\n",
        "- [Corpora](https://github.com/dariusk/corpora): Preformatted lists of things from weather phenomena to names of Greek deities. A project by [Darius Kazemi](http://tinysubversions.com/).\n",
        "- [Train a GPT-2 Text-Generating Model](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1VLG8e7YSEwypxU-noRNhsv5dW4NfTGce): A Colab notebook, like this one, where you can train a machine learning model on a body of text and generate similar output. Works well, but errors are common and some familiarity with Python/GitHub can be helpful. Compiled by [Max Woolf](https://minimaxir.com/).\n",
        "- [spaCy](https://spacy.io/): Super robust library for natural language processing. Takes some know-how to install and use. It's put together by a software company called [Explosion](https://explosion.ai/about).\n",
        "- [Processing](https://processing.org/): A free, friendly starter language with a focus on pedagogy and community. This platform is supported by their non-profit, the [Processing Foundation](https://processingfoundation.org/).\n",
        "- [p5.js](https://p5js.org/): A JavaScript version of Processing featuring an in-browser code editor. The community has a rotating leadership model, and it's currently led by [Moira Turner](https://github.com/mcturner1995).\n",
        "- [ml5.js](https://ml5js.org/): A machine learning library written in JavaScript. It is spiritually indebted to the work and community of Processing + p5.js. This library is maintained by folx in and around [NYU's ITP/IMA program](https://tisch.nyu.edu/itp).\n",
        "- [openFrameworks](https://openframeworks.cc/): A creative coding toolkit, but in C++. It will feel familiar if you come from Processing although it's more low-level. [A team of volunteers](https://github.com/openframeworks/) actively maintain and contribute to it."
